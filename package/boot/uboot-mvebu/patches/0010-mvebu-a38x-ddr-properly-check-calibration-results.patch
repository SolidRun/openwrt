Subject: [PATCH 1/2] mvebu: a38x: ddr : properly check calibration results

'pup' variable is not set; therefore the pup_state[x][pup] is being checked in
a value that is outside the array (pup=5 in the failure that was observed).

'pup' variable needs to be iterated 0..tm->num_of_bus_per_interface.
